## Features/Flows In Progress or Planned
- [ ] Replace hardcoded user ID with auth context (`home.tsx`)
- [ ] Coordinator/Team flows polish
- [ ] More robust match/challenge logic
- [ ] Improved onboarding polish
- [ ] Real-vs-demo data handling

## Refactor / Tech Debt
- [ ] Align Supabase tables with TypeScript interfaces and app flows
- [ ] Move Supabase credentials to environment variables
- [ ] Centralize and type-check theme/icons
- [ ] Improve error handling and loading feedback
- [ ] Ensure demo data and real data are clearly separated

## Supabase Schema Alignment
- **Current:** Tables may not fully match app data flows and interfaces.
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Export current schema from Supabase.
  2. Compare with TypeScript interfaces (profiles, vines, teams, matches, challenges, etc).
  3. Update tables as needed (backup first!).

## Next Suggested Actions
1. Commit or stash your changes in `home.tsx`.
2. Export your Supabase schema (I can guide you step-by-step).
3. Review and update your Supabase tables to match your appâ€™s needs.
4. Replace hardcoded user IDs with actual auth context throughout the app.
5. Continue feature work or refactor as prioritized above.
